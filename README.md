README
This README is for TherAAPy, a web-based app to help people find a therapist, created for Northeastern University’s CS-5200 Database Management course. The goal is to find a user their best match therapist. To do this, a user is asked set of questions and, based on their answers, compared to other users in the system, finding other users with the same profile. These other users have rated previous therapists and the program utilizes their ratings to match the user with the best therapist. 
Future iterations of this app will include more therapy styles, a greater selection of maladys, and algorithmic matching techniques based on a greater set of therapist/user values.
